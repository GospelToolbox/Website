Gospel Toolbox exists to support the church in glorifying God
with gifts and skills in design, software, and technology. 
The tools in Gospel Toolbox are built by the church to fill 
the needs and solve practical problems found in daily church work 
and discipleship. 

Gospel Toolbox supports this work by providing common resources 
(distribution, hosting, and support), and organizing hackathons
and other community efforts to collaborate together for this mission.
